# ChessPlusPlus
A C++ chess game simulator

## Getting started
Clone this repository and compile the code using the makefile. You can then run the executable.

The program accepts moves in the format (source square, destination square), where a square is referred to using a letter in the range A-H and a number in the range 1-8. The program validates each move and keeps track of the state of the game, detecting when the game is over and producing appropriate output to the user.

The moves can be changed from the ChessMain.cpp main function.
